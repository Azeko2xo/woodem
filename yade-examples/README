This directory contains some examples for filegenerators:

2 examples for FEM
1 example for SDEC Impact test
2 examples for tetrahedrons

Other filegenerators work without need for any input file. They generate examples
just by parameters given to them. In the future here will appear more examples.


By default yade filegenerators are looking for those files in ../data directory.
You can specify another directory in filegenerator, but for now you would have to
change it everytime (bug #004853). To avoid the hassle you can just copy content
of this directory to ../data relative to path from where you are starting yade
( most probably bin/ ).

For example my directory tree with yade looks like this:

YADE
|-- bin
|-- data
|-- include
`-- lib
