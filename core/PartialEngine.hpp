/*! \brief Abstract interface for all dii ex machina.

	All kinematic engines must derived from this class. A kinematic engine is used to modify the state of an object
	(position,veloity ...) according to a predefined law (mathematical function, stored data ...) and not according
	to a dynamic law as dynamic engines do. A kinematic engine contains a list of bodies to act on, and bodies can
	subscribe to several dii ex machina.
