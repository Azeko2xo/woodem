Description: Platform for discrete element modeling. Main optimized build
 Yet Another Dynamic Engine.
 .
 Extensible open-source framework for discrete numerical models, 
 focused on Discrete Element Method. 
 The computation parts are written in c++ using flexible object model, 
 allowing independent implementation of new algorithms and interfaces. 
 Python is used for rapid and concise scene construction, 
 simulation control, postprocessing and debugging.
 .
 This package contains speed-optimized build of yade.
