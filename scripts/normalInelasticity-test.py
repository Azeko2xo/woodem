# Script to test the constitutive law contained in NormalInelasticityLaw : consider two spheres moving one to each other (this script illustrates different ways of moving spheres)
#- first penetration of the contact evolves => Monitor of the normal force
#- then, test in tangential direction
#- finally for what concerns moment transfer, with relative orientation changes (use frictionAngle=0.0 in this case to study more easily what's going on)

#Different graphs illustrate the effects of the different loadings. The run is paused at each plot window (so that there is time to observe them). Type "Return" in the Yade terminal to go ahead.

#	- evolution of Fx with gamma normal (flat at the beginning because of the order of engines)
#	- un decreases indeed during this shear, but maybe a zoom on the curves is needed to see it.
#	- We can observe that the force state of the sample decreases a line with a slope equal to tan(~34.5Â°)=tan(~0.602 rad). Why not strict equality ? Because of the measure of the slope or because something else ? To see...
#	- during this phase O.forces.t(0).norm() / O.forces.f(0)[0] seems to increase between 0.502 and 0.507 (according to r=[T[i]/F[i] for i in range(50,T.__len__()-20) ])
#		Note to explain this that Fx = O.forces.f(0)[0] is more and more different from Ft, from which we can expect Ft =
