## Omega is the super-class that orchestrates the whole program.
## It holds the entire simulation (MetaBody), takes care of loading/saving,
## starting/stopping the simulation, loads plugins and more.

## Engines are called consecutively at each iteration. Their order matters.

#	PhysicalActionDamper([

#		CundallNonViscousMomentumDamping(damping=0.2)

#	## Now we have forces and momenta acting on bodies. Newton's law calculates acceleration that corresponds to them.
#	PhysicalActionApplier([

#		NewtonsMomentumLaw(),

#	## Acceleration results in velocity change. Integrating the velocity over dt, position of the body will change.
#	StateMetaEngine([LeapFrogPositionIntegrator()]),
#	## Angular acceleration changes angular velocity, resulting in position and/or orientation change of the body.

## The yade.utils module contains some handy functions, like yade.utils.box and yade.utils.sphere.
## After this import, they will be accessible as utils.box and utils.sphere.
from yade import utils

## create bodies in the simulation: one box in the origin and one floating above it.
##
## The box:
## * extents: half-size of the box. [.5,.5,.5] is unit cube
## * center: position of the center of the box
## * dynamic: it is not dynamic, i.e. will not move during simulation, even if forces are applied to it
## * color: for the 3d display; specified  within unit cube in the RGB space; [1,0,0] is, therefore, red
## * young: Young's modulus
## * poisson: Poissons's ratio

o.bodies.append(utils.box(center=[0,0,0],extents=[.5,.5,.5],color=[0,0,1],dynamic=False))

## (will not be executed, since the condition is never True)
if False:
	# Create empty body object
	b=Body()
	# set the isDynamic body attribute

	# add the body to the simulation
	o.bodies.append(b)


## The sphere
##
## * First two arguments are radius and center, respectively. They are used as "positional arguments" here:
## python will deduce based on where they are what they mean.
##
## It could also be written without using utils.sphere - see gui/py/utils.py for the code of the utils.sphere function
o.bodies.append(utils.sphere([0,0,2],1,color=[0,1,0]))

## Estimate timestep from p-wave speed and multiply it by safety factor of .2
