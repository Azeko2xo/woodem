""" This file shows 2 ways to fill union of triangulated surfaces:
You can either use union of 2 inGtsSurface predicates or
create union of surfaces using GTS calls first and use a single
isGtsSurface as predicate with the united surface.

The disadvantage of the predicate union | is that each sphere must fit whole in one
surface or another: with padding, several points on the sphere are tested. Therefore,
areas near both surfaces' boundary will not be filled at all.

Note that GTS only moves references to surfaces around, therefore e.g. translating
surface that is part of the union will move also the part of the united surface.
Therefore, we use the copy() method for deep copy here.
