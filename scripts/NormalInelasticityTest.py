#Def of the python command letMove() :
# Will move "by hand" the upperSphere towards or away from the lower one. Modifying by hand only the speed of bodies is indeed not sufficient, see NewtonsIntegrator, and https://bugs.launchpad.net/yade/+bug/398089. For such purposes you could also use TranslationEngine, or you can also use StepDisplacer, which applies finite change in position/orientation in each step

#NB : the shape of the curve Fn(un) seems to not be perfect. It is indeed not because of NormalInelasticityLaw. But of differences between the un computed here in this python script and the one which is computed in Ig2_Sphere_Sphere_ScGeom (see for example this "shift2"). Fn being linked to this last un, these slight differences explain the shape of the curves. If phys.penetrationDepth would exist in python, and thus could be directly considered, I think the curve would be perfect !
