#
# Test script for OpenGL from python (and from other threads in general)
# With GL locking, 1 view seems to work reliably, not two views, though.
#
# Some drivers (nvidia) raise XBadAccess if there is an attempt to access
#  OpenGL context concurrently from different threads.
# Other drivers (intel, at least on my laptop) freeze the videocard completely
#  if that is the case.
#
# You can enable the "if False:" part (say "if True:" instead) to see what
# it does in your case.
