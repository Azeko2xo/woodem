INSTALLATION ON UNIX-LIKE OS
-------------------------

 - You need openGL (eg Mesa), glut, libxml (1.0 or 2.0), libtiff
 - Edit Makefile and modify the variable INSTALL_DIR. 
 - Type make, make install.

INSTALLATION ON WIN32 WITH DEV-C++
----------------------------------

 - Install the requiered librairies with Dev-c++ 
   (http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/packages/)
 - Open the project file 'mgpost.dev' (in src directory) with Dev-c++
 - Rebuild all the project, the binary file 'mgpost.exe' will be created
   in the directory src.

INSTALLATION ON MAC OS X
------------------------

 - You need obviously to install the Developper Tools, if not done yet. 
 - You need libtiff. The simpliest way to have it is using Fink
   (http://fink.sourceforge.net), an open source programs manager.  Once
   installed, simply type 'fink install libtiff'. Fink will download and
   install the appropriate files in the /sw root subdirectory. The
   makefile is aware of this location. If you want to install libtiff by
   yourself, you can go to http://www.libtiff.org/.
 - At last, in the main mgpost directory, type 'make macosx' to build
   the program. 'make install' will copy the binary to /usr/local/bin.
