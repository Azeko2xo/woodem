r.298
- new very generic MultiMethods are added, allowing multivirtual call with extra parameters, and easy code reuse

r.291
- better handling of threads, but still not fully stable

r.245
- BoundingVolume now can be used to center scene for display

r.227
- BoundingVolume optimized for each kind of GeometricalModel makes computation almost twice faster

r.225
- some examples are not updated, and therefor not working. it is guaranteed that SDECBenchmark8k will always work.

r.219
- displayed objects are now casting really cool shadows

r.209
- switch at compile time to select float/double precision of calculation

r.182
- yade uses threads now, but still not fully stable

r.180
- for storing Bodies and Interactions we now use polymorphic classes InteractionContainer and BodyContainer

r.154
- math classes are separate from serialization, and done with templates (but with wild-magic license)

r.140
- Serialization now supports almost all std, boost and Loki containers and more

r.127
- LPC solver for ErrorTolerant computations

r.122
- moment rotation law added, mess inside SDECDynamicEngine (three enegines in one!)

r.112
- added NullGUI, so commandline computation is possible

r.108
- started ErrorTolerant DynamicEngine

r.83
- SDECDynamicEngine starts to work with SDEC contact law

r.80
- simple example for SDEC added

r.76
- Serialization uses boost::spirit

r.56
- ClassFactory is now reusable

r.40
- setDebug, setRelease scripts added

r.30
- cloth simulation added

r.17
- first try at multimethods, added class Indexable, and multimethods are used
for collision
