/*! 
\brief	ThreadRunner takes care of starting/stopping (executing) the
	ThreadWorker in the separate thread. 

	It is achieved by either:
	- one execution of { ThreadWorker::singleAction(); } in separate thread
	- a loop { while(looping() ) ThreadWorker::singleAction(); } in separate thread

	Lifetime of ThreadRunner is guaranteed to be longer or equal to
	the lifetime of	the separate thread of execution.

	The ThreadRunner owner must make sure that ThreadWorker has longer or
	equal lifetime than instance of ThreadRunner. Otherwise ThreadRunner
	will try to execute a dead object, which will lead to crash.

	Do not destroy immediately after call to singleAction(). Destructor can
	kick in before a separate thread starts, which will lead to a crash.

	User can explicitly ask the running thread to terminate execution. If
	the thread supports it, it will terminate.

\note	This code is reentrant. Simultaneous requests from other threads to
	start/stop or perform singleAction() are expected.
	   
	So ThreadWorker(s) are running, while the user is interacting with the
	UI frontend (doesn't matter whether the UI is graphical, ncurses or
	any other).
