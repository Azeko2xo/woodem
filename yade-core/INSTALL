INSTALLING:

to compile and install yade-core execute following commands:

	make
	make install
	make clean		# to clean afterwards

by default everything is installed in directory INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local,
if for example you want to install somewhere else instead, you can do this:

As a root user:

	make install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

As a user without root privileages:

        mkdir ~/YADE
        make install INSTALL_DIR='/YADE' PREFIX_DIR='/home/joeuser'

If you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

NOTES:
 1. Both INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR should start with / and shouldn't have
    trailing slash.

 2. If compilation is interrupted (eg. due to some compilation error), and
    then resumed with *different* INSTALL_DIR or PREFIX_DIR, then all *.pro
    files (used by qmake) will be damaged (wrong INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR
    inside)

 3. If you are compiling with gcc3.3, you need to pass additional argument:

	make CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread'

 4. flag CXXFLAGS can be used to set some compilation options, like:

        CXXFLAGS='-O3'                     : optimize code for speed
	CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread -O3'  : gcc3.3, and optimize for speed
	CXXFLAGS='-g'                      : debugging symbols
	CXXFLAGS='-DDOUBLE_PRECISION -O3'  : for calculation use double precision
	                                     instead of float and optimize for speed

OTHER MAKE COMMANDS

	make clean		# to clean afterwards
	make uninstall          # to uninstall (you have to provide
	                        # correct INSTALL_DIR, and PREFIX_DIR )

RUNNING

To start correctly, yade must be able to find its libraries. It means that you
should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the right
directory. Depending on where yade is installed, it can be one of those:

   /usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs
   /home/joeuser/YADE/lib/yade/yade-libs
   /usr/lib/yade/yade-libs

You can do this in following ways:

   1. add following line to your /home/janek/.bashrc or /home/janek/.zshenv

         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs

   2. or everytime before you first start yade in a given terminal issue a command:

         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-libs

note: csh uses setenv instead of export

If you fail to do what is described above, you will get the following error:

./yade: error while loading shared libraries: libyade-lib-threads.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory



FIRST TIME SETUP

After launching yade for the first time, you will be welcomed by "Yade first
use wizard". You will be asked questions, and your answers will be saved in the
directory /home/janek/.yade

1. Specify default GUI name [QtGUI] :

You can safely press enter here. Yade can use many different GUI plugins,
currently there are only two: QtGUI and NullGUI. QtGUI is currently a standard
graphical frontend for yade. NullGUI is a command line interface for yade. In
the future more GUIs can appear, like: ncurses based, GTK, etc.

2. Specify the path where to find it [/usr/local/lib/yade/yade-guis] :

Here you should specify path to yade-guis, it can be one of the following:

   /usr/local/lib/yade/yade-guis
   /home/joeuser/YADE/lib/yade/yade-guis
   /usr/lib/yade/yade-guislibs

Then a graphical window should appear. Next step is to add directories with all
other plugins used by yade. To do so click "Edit-Preferences-Plugin Folders",
and add all directories from lib/yade/ path. This is a daunting task, since
there are currently 8 directories to add (will be fixed with bug #004858). But
you should do it only once. If you are developing your own plugins, and they
reside in some other directory, you should add this directory here.

Then click Plugins on the left, and click a button Rescan. You should see
all C++ classes that are recognized by yade from those plugins.

After that you can normally use yade.
