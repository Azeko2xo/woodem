yade-flat directory is solely for debugging purposes. Shouldn't be packaged or
used by non-developers.

before using it, please run yade-scripts/makeFlat from trunk/ directory, and
make sure that src/src.pro is up to date.

yade-flat is scanning for plugins, this can be considered a bug.
But it's yade-flat specific, so probably will never be fixed.
