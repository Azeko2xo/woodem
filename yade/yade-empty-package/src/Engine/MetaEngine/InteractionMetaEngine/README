BroadInteractionMetaEngine is just an example of InteractionMetaEngine

another exaple is to create artificially an interaction when dispatchng on State - for example
if position of the Body is below some threshold we want to create an Interaction

and for example if you want to delete (not create) an Interaction depending on some criterion it
will be in this directory, for example:

CoulombCriterionMetaEngine
DruckerPragerMetaEngine
