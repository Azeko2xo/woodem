-------- QUICK:

setenv SVN_SSH "ssh -l loginname"
svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk/yade

cd yade/yade/scripts
./prepareToDevelop
source yadeEnv ........../yade
cd ../projects/kdevelop/
qmake
make

cd $YADEBINPATH
yade

--------- end

---------- tagging example:

svn copy svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk/yade svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/tags/yade-0.1/yade-0.1.2-m "Tagging version 0.1.2 after adding multimethods and before adding Cloth"

---------- end

You should know that yade is in early development stage. It compiles and runs,
but is still not very useful.

you need:
- libqglviewer
- libglut development package
- qt3 development package
- kdevelop 3.0 or higher
- qmake (autotools does not support dynamic libraries in required manner)

To get the source, as a developer you do:

>	setenv SVN_SSH "ssh -l loginname"
>	svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/yade/trunk/yade

or, to have an anonymous checkout:

>	svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/yade/trunk/yade

# Then you should set an environment variable YADEPATH, because kdevelop uses it
# to compile everything, for example (make sure there is no trailing slash!! "/"):
#
# >	scripts/setEnvVar
  or put it into .bashrc


All the sources are inside src/ dircetory, and kdevelop uses them in another
directory, so you need to make symliks:

>	cd yade
>	./makeSymLinks

After that you can run kdevelop (version 3.0 or higher) for debian it's kdevelop3
for redhat it's kdevelop. You should run it from the same terminal in which all the
environment variables are set, because kdevelop will use them.

>	kdevelop

Now, when kdevelop3 has started you can open a project which is here:
>	$YADEPATH/projects/kdevelop/yade_kdevelop/yade_kdevelop.kdevelop

Then select from menu "Build->Build Project", and wait. Ewentually you should
see "success" at the end of compiling. If you don't - check if you have
libqglviewer and qt3 development package.

After that you can either run YADEPATH/bin/yade by hand (but with correct
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or it won't start!) or you can click tab called "Qmake manager"
then select "yade", and click "run subproject" icon.

Hopefully you should see yade running.
