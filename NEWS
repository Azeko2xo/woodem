	* RELEASE: 0.12

	* Sega's facets and vertices with stl import
	
	* python wrapper and console with the ability to control most simulation aspects (including creating simulations, modifying, inspecting, running, recording data), some parts of the UI (setting view, configuring renderer); see scripts/simple-scene.py to get started (http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/SimpleSceneTutorial)

	* (experimental) plotting interface based on pylab (scripts/simple-scene-graph.py)

	* much enhanced simulation recorder and player, saving optionally to a single file (sqlite database), the ability to create video from simulation with one command (may be done offscreen as well): scripts/simple-scene-player.py, http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/New:Making_videos

	* selectively block any of 6 DOFs ( translation and rotation) for individual bodies (PhysicalParameters::blockedDOFs - not documented, not conveniently accessible from python yet)

	* displacement and rotation scaling in GLViewer, using PhysicalParameters::refSe3
	
	* up to 3 clipping planes in the GLViewer, can be manipulated, bound to each other, activated/deactivated

	* saving view to view configurations inside MetaBody (Alt+7 -- Alt+9), can be loaded later (from python as well)

	* all simulation aspects (dt, iteration, virtual time) are now inside MetaBody, i.e. are restored exactly as they were from .xml

	* transparent support for compressed .xml.gz and .xml.bz2 files; dropped support for binary format

	* the (de)serializer now (un)escapes all control characters, using the &charname; format, arbitrary string values can be (de)serialized now, including parentheses, quotations marks, newlines, tabs, <>.

	* refactored Qt3 interface: MDI with simulation running asynchronously, with python console

	* QGLViewer source is now in our tree, no need to install it separately

	* compilation profiles allow separate option sets for scons; simultaneous compilation of multiple profiles is supported via the profile=a,b,c
