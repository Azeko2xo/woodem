This is the README for the sqlite3x and sq3 C++ wrappers for sqlite3.

sqlite3x: this is an OO C++ wrapper for the sqlite3 API. It makes
heavy use of exceptions to report any sort of error. It based off code
written by Cory Nelson. Please see the file sqlite3x.hpp for the
license.

sq3: this is also an OO C++ wrapper for sqlite3. It is similar in
design to sqlite3x but does not use exceptions. It is intended for
platforms, like PocketPC, where exceptions support may not be
available/desireable. This API is released into the Public Domain.


ACHTUNG: the wide-character/string support may or may not work on your
platform. On my platform (GNU/Linux), std::wstring uses 4-byte wide
chars, whereas sqlite3 expects 2-byte chars. That means that the code
is untested on my platform and almost certainly doesn't work. It
"might" work on Win32 platforms.  The sqlite3x API inherits a
nearly-complete wide-char implementation from Corey's original
code. The sq3 API, which was written from scratch, does not have any
wchar API.
