Contents of this directory is a copy of upstream from http://artis.imag.fr/Software/QGLViewer/, as of

2007-08-28 23:40 libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3.tar.gz

SConscript file is mostly cut&paste from the original .pro file. EXCEPT for these 2 files:

 ImageInterface.Qt3.cpp
 VRenderInterface.Qt3.cpp

which are generated by uic in the upstream directory (qmake&&make),
but I have no idea how to get the using scons automatically.
