Contents of this directory is a copy of upstream from http://artis.imag.fr/Software/QGLViewer/, as of

2007-08-28 23:40 libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3.tar.gz

SConscript file is mostly cut&paste from the original .pro file. Since the qt3 tool in scons doesn't properly
handle files named like VRenderInterace.Qt3.ui (multiple suffixes), two offending files are symlinked to 

 VRenderInterface_Qt3.ui
 ImageInterface_Qt3.ui

and the following change is needed then:

This has to be kept in mind when synchronizing with upstream.
