Basic simulation
#################

Scene
=======

The whole simulation is contained in a single :obj:`woo.core.Scene` object, which contains the rest; a scene can be can be loaded from and saved to a file, just like any other object. Scene defines things like timestep (:obj:`~woo.core.Scene.dt`) or periodic boundary conditions (:obj:`~woo.core.Scene.cell`).

It also contains several :obj:`fields <woo.core.Field>`; each field is dedicated to a one simulation method, and the fields can be semi-independent. As we go for a DEM simulation, the important field for us is a :obj:`~woo.dem.DemField`; that is the one containing particles and contacts (we deal with that later); we can also define gravity acceleration for this field by setting :obj:`DemField.gravity <woo.dem.DemField.gravity>`.

There can be an unlimited number of scenes, each of them independent of others. Only one can be controlled by the UI (and shown in the 3d view); it is the one assigned to :obj:`woo.master.scene <woo.core.Master>`, the master scene object.

New scene with the DEM field can be initialized in this way:

.. code-block:: python

   import woo, woo.core, woo.dem   # import modules we use
   S=woo.core.Scene()              # create the scene object
   f=woo.dem.DemField()            # create the field object
   f.gravity=(0,0,-9.81)           # set gravity acceleration
   S.fields=[f]                     # add field to the scene
   woo.master.scene=S              # this will be the master scene now

Since all objects can take *keyword arguments* when constructed, and assignments can be chained in Python, this can be written in a much more compact way::

   S=woo.master.scene=woo.core.Scene(fields=[woo.dem.DemField(gravity=(0,0,-9.81))])

..
	asdfasdf

   .. ipython::

      Woo [1]: import woo, woo.core, woo.dem

      Woo [2]: woo.master.scene



The DEM field can be accessed as ``S.fields[0]``, but this is not very convenient. There is a shorthand defined, ``S.dem``, which always returns the (first) DEM field attached to the scene object.

Particles
==========

Particles are held in the :obj:`DemField.par <woo.dem.DemField.particles>` container (shorthand for :obj:`DemField.particles <woo.dem.DemField.particles>`); new particles can be added using the :obj:`append <woo.dem.DemField.append>` method.

Particles are not simple objects; they hold together :obj:`material <woo.dem.Material>` and :obj:`shape <woo.dem.Shape>` (the geometry -- such as :obj:`~woo.dem.Sphere`, :obj:`~woo.dem.Capsule`, :obj:`~woo.dem.Wall`, ...) and other thigs. :obj:`~woo.dem.Shape` is attached to one (for mononodal particles, like :obj:`spheres <woo.dem.Sphere>`) or several (for multinodal particles, like :obj:`facets <woo.dem.Facet>`) nodes with some :obj:`position <woo.core.Node.pos>` and :obj:`orientation <woo.core.Node.ori>`, each node holds :obj:`~woo.dem.DemData` containing :obj:`~woo.dem.DemData.mass`, :obj:`~woo.dem.DemData.inertia`, :obj:`velocity <woo.dem.DemData.vel>` and so on.

To avoid complexity, there are utility functions that take a few input data and return a finished :obj:`~woo.dem.Particle`.

We can define an infinite plane (:obj:`~woo.dem.Wall`) in the :math:`xy`-plane with :math:`z=0` and add it to the scene::

   wall=woo.dem.Wall.make(0,axis=2)
   S.dem.par.append(wall)

Walls are *fixed* by default, and the :obj:`woo.utils.defaultMaterial` was used as :obj:`~woo.dem.Particle.material` -- the default material is not good for real simulations, but it is handy for quick demos. We also define a :obj:`sphere <woo.dem.Sphere>` and put it in the space above the wall::

   sphere=woo.dem.Sphere.make((0,0,2),radius=.2)
   S.dem.par.append(sphere)

The :obj:`~woo.dem.ParticleContainer.append` method can also take several particles as list, so we can add both particles in a compact way::

   S.dem.par.append([
      woo.dem.Wall.make(0,axis=2),
      woo.dem.Sphere.make((0,0,2),radius=.2)
   ])

or in one line::

   S.dem.par.append([woo.dem.Wall.make(0,axis=2),woo.dem.Sphere.make((0,0,2),radius=.2)])

Besides creating the particles, it must also be said which nodes we actually want to have moving, i.e. subject to motion integration. In most basic cases, we will want all nodes to move, and there is a convenience function to collect all particles' nodes and put them into :obj:`S.dem.nodes <woo.core.Field.nodes>`::

   S.dem.collectNodes()

If we fail to do this, the integrator will collect them automatically, but will issue a warning.

Engines
========

After adding particles to the scene, we need to tell Woo what to do with those particles. :obj:`Scene.engines <woo.core.Scene.engines>` describe things to do. Engines are run one after another; once the sequence finishes, :obj:`~woo.core.Scene.time` is incremented by :obj:`~woo.core.Scene.dt`, :obj:`~woo.core.Scene.step` is incremented by one, and the sequence starts over.

Although the engine sequence can get complex, there is a pre-cooked engine sequence :obj:`DemField.minimalEngines <woo.dem.DemField.minimalEngines()>` suitable for most scenarios; it consists of the minimum of what virtually every DEM simulation needs:

* motion integration (compute accelerations from contact forces and gravity on nodes, update velocities and positions);
* collision detection (find particle overlaps)
* contact resolution (compute forces resulting from overlaps; without any other parameters, the linear contact model is used);

Assigning the engines is simple::

   S.engines=S.dem.minimalEngines(damping=.2)

Notice that we passed the :obj:`~woo.dem.Leapfrog.damping` parameter, which is necessary for models without internal dissipation; more on this later.

Extras
=======

Two handy things to do before we run the simulation:

1. Limit the simulation speed; this is never used for big simulations, but now we want to see things as they happen. We can insert a small pause after each step (here we use 5ms)::

      S.throttle=5e-3

2. Save the simulation so that we can quickly reload it using the :guilabel:`â†»` (reload) button::

      S.saveTmp()

The :obj:`woo.core.Object.saveTmp` function saves to the memory, so everything will be lost when Woo finishes, but that is just fine now.

Running
========

All in all, the minimal simulation of a sphere falling onto plane looks like this:

.. note:: To avoid typing ``woo.dem`` all the time, the module :obj:`woo.dem` was imported as ``from woo.dem import *``; the same could be also done with the :obj:`woo.core` module.


.. literalinclude:: basic-1.py

Save this to a file, name it e.g. ``basic-1.py`` (or whatever ending with ``.py``, which is the extension indicating `Python <http://www.python.org>`__) and run woo from the terminal by typing::

   woo basic-1.py

You should see something similar to this::

   Welcome to Woo /r3484
   Running script basic-1.py
   [[ ^L clears screen, ^U kills line. F12 controller, F11 3d view, F10 both, F9 generator, F8 plot. ]]
   Woo [1]:

and the controller window opens. The script was executed, but the simulation is not yet running -- the script does not ask for that. Click on the :guilabel:`3D` button to look at the scene and something like this appears:

.. figure:: fig/basic-1-controller-3d.png
   :align: center

   User interface after running the :woosrc:`basic-1.py <doc/source/sphinx2/tutorial/basic-1.py>` script.
