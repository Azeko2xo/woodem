.. admonition:: Overview

   This chapter explains particle masks and how to create mesh -- by importing or by paramteric construction.

STL import
===========

`STL (STereoLitography) file format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29>`__ is an interchange format for triangulated sorfaces in 3d. It is used as a possible export format in many CAD systems. There is a single function for their import, :obj:`woo.utils.importSTL <_utils2.importSTL>` which return list of facet particles, which can be added to the simulation instantly::

   S.dem.par.append(woo.utils.importSTL('your-model.stl'),mat=woo.utils.defaultMaterial())

.. figure:: fig/ship-mesh.png
   :align: center

   Mesh imported from the STL file.

The :obj:`woo.utils.importSTL <_utils2.importSTL>` function has options for scaling, shifting, rotating and assigning colors -- check its documentation for details.


Parametric surfaces
====================

`GNU Triangulated Surface library <http://gts.sourceforce.net>`__ is a library for constructing and manipulating triangulated surfaces. There are a few convenience functions in Woo for converting lists of points into a GTS surface, which can be again converted to list of facets easily, and added to the simulation.

For example, let's create V-shaped conveyor bed with flad bottom. Let's work in local coordinates first, so that :math:`x`-axis is the conveyor axis, :math:`y` is horizontal and :math:`z` is vertical. The dimensions of the bed will be:

* ``botWd``, flat bottom width
* ``sideWd``, elevated side width
* ``sideHt``, elevated side height

The bed will start at :math:`x=0` and will go up to :math:`x=x_1` (``x1``) with ``xDiv`` segments:

.. ipython::

   @suppress
   Woo [1]: S=Scene(fields=[DemField()])

   # set parameters
   Woo [1]: botWd=.3; sideWd=.2; sideHt=.1; x1=2; xDiv=5

   Woo [1]: import numpy

   # x points where polylines will be defined
   Woo [1]: xx=numpy.linspace(0,x1,num=xDiv)

   Woo [1]: print xx

   # for each x, create the polyline with 4 points
   Woo [1]: pts=[[(x,-.5*botWd-sideWd,sideHt),(x,-.5*botWd,0),(x,.5*botWd,0),(x,.5*botWd+sideWd,sideHt)] for x in xx]

   Woo [1]: print pts

   # convert list of polylines to a gts surface (all must have the same number of points)
   Woo [1]: surf=woo.pack.sweptPolylines2gtsSurface(pts)

   Woo [1]: print surf

   # convert surface to facets and add them to the scene
   Woo [1]: S.dem.par.append(woo.pack.gtsSurface2Facets(surf))

If one wants to convert from local to global coordinates, define local coordinates via :obj:`~woo.core.Node` and pass it as the ``localCoords`` parameter to :obj:`woo.pack.sweptPolylines2gtsSurface`:

.. ipython::

   @suppress
   Woo [1]: import math

   Woo [1]: node=Node(pos=(.2,.2,.2),ori=((0,0,1),math.pi/3.))

   Woo [1]: surf=woo.pack.sweptPolylines2gtsSurface(pts,localCoords=node)

or use the node object manually to convert all points:

.. ipython::

   Woo [1]: pts=[[node.loc2glob(p) for p in pp] for pp in pts]

   Woo [1]: surf=woo.pack.sweptPolylines2gtsSurface(pts)

Behind the scenes, :obj:`~woo.core.Node.loc2glob` does nothing else than transforming the local point :math:`p'` using the local origin position :math:`O` and orientation :math:`q` as

.. math:: p=q(p'+O)q^*

or, in Python, ``n.ori*(p+n.pos)``.

.. note:: Quaternions are constructed from the `Axis-angle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_angle>`__ representation of rotations; angles are always given in radians. Thus e.g. ``Quaternion((0,0,1),math.pi/3.)`` rotates around the :math:`z`-axis by :math:`\frac{\pi}{3}\equiv60Â°`.

In summary, the conveyor code looks like this, in a compact way:

.. literalinclude:: mesh-bed.py

.. figure:: fig/conveyor-mesh.png
   :align: center

   Conveyor bed mesh created parametrically by the script above.

.. warning:: Do **not** call :obj:`woo.dem.DemField.collectNodes` once a mesh is added to :obj:`S.dem.par <woo.dem.DemField.particles>`. All nodes would be made subject to motion integration, which is not something you want for static meshes!

.. todo:: Think about ways how to make :obj:`woo.dem.DemField.collectNodes` smarter.


Note on particle masks
=======================

:obj:`Particle.mask <woo.dem.Particle.mask>` is a `bit array <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array>`__ which determines which particles may have contacts with other particles. Mask is a regular (integer) number in the memory, but is interpreted as individual bits, for example like this::

    0000 0010     = 2 in decimal
    0000 0011     = 3 in decimal
    0000 0110     = 6 in decimal

Binary numbers can be written in python directly, e.g. ``0b0010`` would be the first bit array, equal to ``2`` in decimal.

There are two basic rules:

1. Particles collide only if they have a common bit (that is, if their `bitwise AND <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND>`__ is nonzero: ``maskA & maskB !=0``).

2. If a common bit is contained in :obj:`DemField.loneMask <woo.dem.DemField.loneMask>`, the particles will not collide. This rule is to avoid collisions of particles where it is meaningless, such as facets in a mesh between themselves. With meshes, the number of spurious "contacts" can be **very high** (thousands) slowing down the simulation unnecessarily.

Mask bits can be further used for marking particles (e.g. with :obj:`~woo.dem.BoxDeleter`, when :obj:`~woo.dem.BoxDeleter.markMask` is set) in arbitrary ways.

**Default values** of mask are different for different particles:

1. Particles which usually move (:obj:`~woo.dem.Sphere`, :obj:`~woo.dem.Ellipsoid`, :obj:`~woo.dem.Capsule`) have the mask set to ``0b0001`` by default (when created using the :obj:`Sphere.make <woo.dem.Sphere.make>` etc functions).

2. Particles usually acting as the boundary (:obj:`~woo.dem.Facet`, :obj:`~woo.dem.InfCylinder`, :obj:`~woo.dem.Wall`) set the mask to ``0b0011`` by default.

3. :obj:`DemField.loneMask <woo.dem.DemField.loneMask>` default to ``0b0010``.

This means that any contacts between boundary particles (:obj:`~woo.dem.Facet` + :obj:`~woo.dem.Facet` and such) are avoided, but that boundary will still interact with particles which usually move.

If the default behavior is not sufficiently flexible ofr your setup, it can be always tuned by hand.
