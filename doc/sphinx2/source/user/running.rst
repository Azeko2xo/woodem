Command-line options
=====================

Woo is primarily a computation program, with only optional graphical user-interface. To run woo, type ``woo`` in the terminal (use ``wwoo`` under Windows). A number of options can be specified, given using UNIX convention of ``--long-option`` or ``-s`` (short option). A help on all available options is obtained with ``woo -h``::

    usage: woo [-h] [--version] [-j THREADS] [--cores CORES] [--cl-dev CLDEV] [-n]
               [-D] [--quirks QUIRKS] [--flavor FLAVOR] [-c COMMANDS] [-e EXPR]
               [--paused] [--nice NICE] [-x] [-v] [-R] [--test] [--no-gdb]
               [--in-gdb] [--in-pdb] [--in-valgrind]

Options important for everyday use are the following ones:

``-j THREADS``
    Number of CPU cores to use for computation. Woo is parallelized using `OpenMP <http://www.openmp.org>`_, and runs on 4 cores by default (or less, if the machine has less than 4). Depending on hardware and the nature of simulation, reasonable value is usually around `-j4`. Woo must have been compiled with the ``openmp`` feature for this option to have any effect.
``-e``
	Evaluate given expression (should yield a :obj:`Scene <woo.core.Scene>` or a :obj:`Preprocessor <woo.core.Preprocessor>`)
``-n``
    Run without graphical interface.
``-x``
    End once the simulation (or script) finishes.
``--paused``
    When loading a simulation from the command line (below), don't have it run immediately.
``-R``
	Recompile Woo before running. Useful during development when sources are modified.
``-RR``
	Update sources from the repository, recompile and run.

Woo takes an additional argument (existing file) coming after options. It can be

#. ``*.py``: python script which will be interpreted by Woo.
#. Saved simulation (in any :ref:`supported format <serializationFormats>`), which will be loaded and run by Woo.
#. Preprocessor, which will be run to create a new simulation, which will be run by Woo.

Once Woo starts, it shows an embedded command-prompt based on `IPython <http://www.ipython.org>`_. It can be used as general-purpose python console and to inspect and modify simulations.

To get started with scripting Woo, you should get familiar with Python, for instance using `Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/>`_.


Import as python module
========================

Woo can be used in python scripts. You only have to say ``import woo`` and everything should just work. Parameters which cannot be changed once ``woo`` is imported can be set via the ``wooOptions`` module:

.. code-block:: python

    import wooOptions
    wooOptions.ompThreads=4
    wooOptions.debug=True
    import woo    # initializes OpenMP to 4 threads, and uses the debug build of woo

Graphical interface
===================

Graphical interface is entirely optional in Woo, simulations can run without it (with the `-n` switch, when no `$DISPLAY` is available, in batch, or if compiled without the ``qt4`` feature).

Controller
----------
The main Woo window, called :obj:`controller <woo.qt.ControllerClass>`, is brought up automatically at startup if a simulation/script is given on the command-line (under Windows, the controller is always shown at startup). The controller can be manually brought up by pressing ``F12`` in the terminal, or by typing ``woo.qt.Controller()``. The window (when the first, *Simulation* tab, is active) looks like this:

.. image:: fig/controller-simulation.*

It is divided in several blocks --

A. Time display (simulation time, clock time, step number, timestep)
B. Loading/saving simulation, file where the simulation was last saved
C. Running controls:
	* start/stop
	* advance by one timestep (or multiple steps, or substep)
	* reload from last saved file
D. Display controls (toggle)
	* 3d (OpenGL) window
	* 2d plot window
	* Inspector
E. Area for simulation-specific controls, if defined (:obj:`woo.core.Scene.uiBuild`)


Display
--------

The *Display* tab configures the 3D display. Woo dispatches OpenGL display of all objects to objects (always called ``Gl1_*``) responsible for actual drawing, which is also how this dialogue is organized.

.. image:: fig/controller-display.*

Note that blue object/attribute labels are active (that works generally, for any object displayed in the user interface):
* left-click opens online documentation for that particular class/attribute.
* mid-click will copy *path* to that object to the clipboard (if it is available), which can be then used in python.
* each attribute has tooltip showing full documentation for that attribute; just hover over the label.

:obj:`Renderer <woo.gl.Renderer>` configures global view properties -- initial orientation, displacement scaling, lighting, clipping, and which general items are displayed.

:obj:`Gl1_DemField <woo.dem.Gl1_DemField>` (shown on the image) is reponsible for displaying contents of DEM simulations (:obj:`woo.dem.DemField`) -- particles, contacts between particles and so on. For instance, particles corresponding to the :obj:`shape <woo.gl.Gl1_DemField.shape>` attribute are colored using the method specified with :obj:`colorBy <woo.gl.Gl1_DemField.colorBy>`. Other particles (not matching :obj:`shape <woo.gl.Gl1_DemField.shape>`, or not able to be colored using :obj:`colorBy <woo.gl.Gl1_DemField.colorBy>`, e.g. non-spherical particle by radius) are colored using :obj:`colorBy2 <woo.gl.Gl1_DemField.colorBy2>`.

Display of each particle's :obj:`shape <woo.dem.Shape>` is dispatched to :obj:`Gl1_* <woo.gl.GlShapeFunctor>` objects (e.g. :obj:`woo.gl.Gl1_Sphere`, :obj:`woo.gl.Gl1_Facet`, â€¦), which control shape-specific options, such as display quality.


.. _preprocessor_gui:

Preprocessor
------------

Preprocessors can be set and run from the *Preprocess* tab, which can be opened directly from the terminal with ``F9`` (Linux-only).

.. image:: fig/controller-preprocessor.*

In the top selection, all available preprocessors are listed. Preprocessor can be modified, loaded and saved. Once you have set all parameters, the *play* button bottom right will create new simulation and switch to the *Simulation* tab automatically.

Unit specifications are only representation. Technically is Woo unit-agnostic, practically, `SI units <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_units>`_ are used everywhere.

.. todo:: Link to unit documentation.


The preprocessor can be saved for later use (it is saved, by default, as python expression)::

    ##woo-expression##
    #: import woo.pre.triax,woo.dem
    woo.pre.triax.TriaxTest(
    	isoStress=-10000.0,
    	maxStrainRate=0.001,
    	nPar=2000,
    	mat=woo.dem.FrictMat(density=100000000.0, id=-1, young=100000.0, tanPhi=0.0, ktDivKn=0.2),
    	tanPhi2=0.6,
    	psd=[(0.001, 0.0), (0.002, 0.2), (0.004, 1.0)],
    	reportFmt='/tmp/{tid}.xhtml',
    	packCacheDir='.',
    	saveFmt='/tmp/{tid}-{stage}.bin.gz',
    	backupSaveTime=1800,
    	pWaveSafety=0.7,
    	nonViscDamp=0.4,
    	initPoro=0.7
    )
