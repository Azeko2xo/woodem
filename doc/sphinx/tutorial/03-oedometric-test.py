# gravity deposition, continuing with oedometric test after stabilization
# shows also how to run parametric studies with yade-batch

# The components of the batch are:
# 1. table with parameters, one set of parameters per line (ccc.table)
# 2. utils.readParamsFromTable which reads respective line from the parameter file
# 3. the simulation muse be run using yade-batch, not yade
#
# $ yade-batch --job-threads=1 03-oedometric-test.table 03-oedometric-test.py
#

# load parameters from file if run in batch
# default values are used if not run from batch
utils.readParamsFromTable(rMean=.05,rRelFuzz=.3,maxLoad=1e6,minLoad=1e4)
# make rMean, rRelFuzz, maxLoad accessible directly as variables later
