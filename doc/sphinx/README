Generating yade documentation
===============================

1. Get sphinx 1.0 (development snapshots are fine) either form 

* packages at https://launchpad.net/~yade-users/+archive/external

* from its repository:

** hg branch http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/
** optionally apply the patch (only avoids warnings) from
     http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/407/patch-do-not-inspect-boost-python-functions
** run 
     python setup.py install

2. Python default encoding must be set to utf-8. As it is not the default, PYTHONPATH=. is used to make Python import local sitecustomize.py file at startup which changes this setting. (The value cannot be set after startup, from within the script)

3. Run (from the current directory)

	PYTHONPATH=. yade yadeSphinx.py [optional outDir; _build by default]

It will be create/update $outDir/{html,latex}. The latex file (Yade.tex) is to be processed with xelatex (rather than latex). See README.latex for details.

ipython_console_highlighting.py is copied from matplotlib's trunk/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/sphinxext
