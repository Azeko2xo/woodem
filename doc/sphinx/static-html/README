This directory is currently empty, but might contain static files for the
HTML output. From conf.py:

	# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
	# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
	# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
	html_static_path = ['static-html']
