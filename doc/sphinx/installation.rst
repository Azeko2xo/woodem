Installation
###############

Yade can be installed from packages (precompiled binaries) or source code. The choice depends on what you need: if you don't plan to modify Yade itself, package installation is easier. In the contrary case, you must download and install source code.

Packages
----------

Packages are (as of now) provided for several Ubuntu versions from ``Yade package archive`` for `stable <https://launchpad.net/~yade-pkg/+archive/stable>`_ and `snapshot <https://launchpad.net/~yade-pkg/+archive/snapshots>`_ releases. Different version of Yade can be installed alongside each other. The ``yade`` virtual package always depends on the latest stable package, while ``yade-snapshot`` will pull the latest snapshot package. To install quickly, run the following:

* For stable releases::

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yade-pkg/stable       # for stable releases 
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yade-users/external   # optional (updates of other packages)
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install yade

* For latest builds from trunk::

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yade-pkg/snapshots    # for latest releases 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install yade-bzr...

More detailed instructions are available at the corresponding pages of ppa`s (links above).

Source code
------------

Installation from source code is reasonable, when you want to add or modify constitutive laws, engines or functions... Installing the latest trunk version allows to use newly added features, which are not yet available in packaged versions. 

Download
^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to install from source, you can install either a release (numbered version, which is frozen) or the current developement version (updated by the developers frequently). You should download the development version (called ``trunk``) if you want to modify the source code, as you might encounter problems that will be fixed by the developers. Release version will not be modified (except for updates due to critical and easy-to-fix bugs), but they are in a more stabilized state that trunk generally.

#. Releases can be downloaded from the `download page <https://launchpad.net/yade/+download>`_, as compressed archive. Uncompressing the archive gives you a directory with the sources.

#. developement version (trunk) can be obtained from the `code repository <https://code.launchpad.net/yade/>`_ at Launchpad. We use `Bazaar <http://www.bazaar-vcs.org>`_ (the ``bzr`` command) for code management (install the ``bzr`` package in your distribution)::

		bzr checkout lp:yade

   will download the whole code repository of ``trunk``. Check out `Quick Bazaar tutorial <https://yade-dem.org/wiki/Quick_Bazaar_tutorial>`_ wiki page for more. For those behind firewall, `daily snapshot <http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/yade/yade-trunk-latest.tar.bz2>`_ of the repository (as compressed archive) is provided.

Release and trunk sources are compiled in the same way.

Prerequisities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yade relies on a number of external software to run; its installation is checked before the compilation starts. 

* `scons <http://www.scons.org>`_ build system
* `gcc <http://www.gcc.gnu.org>`_ compiler (g++); other compilers will not work; you need g++>=4.2 for openMP support
* `boost <http://www.boost.org/>`_ 1.35 or later
* `qt3 <http://www.qt.nokia.com>`_ library
* `freeglut3 <http://freeglut.sourceforge.net>`_
* `libQGLViewer <http://www.libqglviewer.com>`_
* `python <http://www.python.org>`_, `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_, `ipython <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_
* `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sf.net>`_
* `eigen2 <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org>`_ algebra library
* `gdb <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb>`_ debugger
* `sqlite3 <http://www.sqlite.org>`_ database engine
* `Loki <http://loki-lib.sf.net>`_ library
* `VTK <http://www.vtk.org/>`_ library (optional but recommended)

Most of the list above is very likely already packaged for your distribution. The following commands have to be executed in command line of corresponding distributions. Just copy&paste to the terminal. To perform commands you should have root privileges

	* **Ubuntu**, **Debian** and their derivatives::

		sudo apt-get install scons freeglut3-dev libloki-dev \
		libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev \
		libboost-regex-dev fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essential g++ \
		libboost-iostreams-dev liblog4cxx10-dev python-dev libboost-python-dev ipython \
		python-matplotlib libsqlite3-dev python-numeric python-tk gnuplot doxygen \
		libgts-dev python-pygraphviz libvtk5-dev python-scientific bzr bzrtools libeigen2-dev \
		binutils-gold python-xlib python-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools \
		libqglviewer-qt4-dev python-imaging libjs-jquery python-sphinx

	* **Fedora**::

		yum install scons qt3-devel freeglut-devel boost-devel boost-date-time \
		boost-filesystem boost-thread boost-regex fakeroot gcc gcc-c++ boost-iostreams \
		log4cxx log4cxx-devel python-devel boost-python ipython python-matplotlib \
		sqlite-devel python-numeric ScientificPython-tk gnuplot doxygen gts-devel \
		graphviz-python vtk-devel ScientificPython bzr bzrtools eigen2-devel libQGLViewer-devel \
		loki-lib-devel python-xlib PyQt4 PyQt4-devel python-imaging python-sphinx python-bibtex

	* **Gentoo** (not good tested yet)
		* Command to install all main dependencies::
		
			emerge dev-util/scons media-libs/freeglut media-libs/gd sys-libs/lib-compat-loki \
			dev-util/boost-build dev-libs/boost sys-apps/fakeroot app-arch/dpkg \
			sys-devel/gcc dev-libs/log4cxx dev-lang/python dev-python/ipython \
			dev-python/matplotlib dev-db/sqlite dev-python/numpy dev-lang/tk \
			sci-visualization/gnuplot app-doc/doxygen sci-libs/gts dev-python/pygraphviz \
			sci-libs/vtk dev-python/scientificpython dev-vcs/bzr dev-vcs/bzrtools dev-cpp/eigen \
			sys-devel/binutils dev-python/python-xlib x11-libs/qt-gui dev-python/PyQt4 dev-python/imaging \
			dev-python/sphinx dev-python/imaging dev-python/python-bibtex
		
		
		* *masked by* problem solution. 
			For example, if you have got a problem with installing ``log4cxx``:
			
				!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "dev-libs/log4cxx" have been masked.
				!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
				- dev-libs/log4cxx-0.10.0 (masked by: ~x86 keyword)
			
			You should unmask ``log4cxx``, doing the following::
			
				mkdir /etc/portage -p;\
				echo "=dev-libs/log4cxx-0.10.0 ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords;\
				emerge dev-libs/log4cxx
			
			Other packages with similar warnings can be fixed by this way as well.
			
		* ``libqglviewer`` is not in official Gentoo repository yet. But it can be installed from `Gentoo Portage Overlay <http://gpo.zugaina.org>`_::
			
			emerge -va layman; emerge subversion; layman -f -a sunrise;\
			echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf \
			layman -s sunrise; layman -S; emerge x11-libs/libqglviewer
		
		* Probably ``media-libs/gd`` will require the following commands::
			
			mkdir /etc/portage -p;\
			echo "media-libs/gd fontconfig jpeg png truetype" >>/etc/portage/package.use
			
			

Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside the directory where you downloaded the sources (ex "yade" if you use bazaar), install Yade to your home directory (without root priviledges)::

	scons PREFIX=/home/username/YADE

If you have a machine that you are the only user on, you can instead change permission on ``/usr/local`` and install subsequently without specifying the ``PREFIX``::

	sudo chown user: /usr/local    # replace "user" with your login name
	scons

There is a number of options for compilation you can change; run ``scons -h`` to see them (see also :ref:`scons-parameters` in the *Programmer's manual*)

The compilation process can take a long time, be patient.

Decreasing RAM usage during compilation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Yade demands a large amount of memory for compilation (due to extensive template use). If you have less than 2GB of RAM, it will be, you might encounter difficulties such as the computer being apparently stalled, compilation taking very long time (hours) or erroring out. This command will minimize RAM usage, but the compilation will take longer -- only one file will be compiled simultaneously and files will be "chunked" together one by one::

	scons jobs=1 chunkSize=1
