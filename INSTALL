= Prerequistes =
================

All libraries listed below must be installed with development headers. It's
better to install them using your linux's distribution package management
system, instead of downloading directly from the website. With the exception of
QGLViewer ( http://artis.imag.fr/Software/QGLViewer/ ) and
wildmagic 3.11 ( http://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html ), which
may not have a packege in your linux distribution.

== Required packages ==
=======================

* ( http://www.boost.org ) 
  boost library 1.33 or later with components: ''date-time'', ''filesystem'' and ''thread''

* ( http://trolltech.com/products/qt/qt3 ) 
  qt3 library, including ''multithreading'' (<tt>-mt</tt>) component

* freeglut3 / libglut3 development files

* ( http://artis.imag.fr/Software/QGLViewer/ )
  QGLViewer

* make, g++

* ( http://www.scons.org/ )
  scons build system


== Optional packages ==
=======================

* ( http://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html )
  wildmagic 3.11 - only if you want Delaunay triangulation support in lattice model

* ( http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/ )
  log4cxx - only if you want extensive logging support in debugging

* python-dev, python-scientific - only if you want python scripting interface</small>

= Recommended installation method =
===================================

Run this command from inside yade-0.11.1 directory to install yade as a local
user without root privileages (recommended):

 scons PREFIX=/home/''username''/YADE optimize=1

Replace 'username' with your user name. Also check out =Scons options= below to
quickly compile not optimized version or systemwide install from debian package
(as a root user), etc.

========================

= Systemwide installation as root =
===================================

By default yade installs in directory /usr/local, but to install there you need
a root access. So running just scons some options should be enough. However,
since you want to install yade systemwide as root, it might be better if you
built a debian package instead.


== Installing from debian source packages ==
============================================

This_repository ( http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade ) contains weekly
snapshots from svn in the form of debian source packages. To compile and
install these (assuming that you already have required packages installed), you
need to add repository source do your '/etc/apt/ sources.list':

  deb-src http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade ./

Pick a revision number you want (eg. 1234), based on the repository contents -
see http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade, then run:

  apt-get source yade-svn1234
  sudo apt-get build-dep yade-svn1234
  cd yade-svn1234-1
  fakeroot-tcp debian/rules binary

Once compiled, you will have optimized (yade-svn1234), debug (yade-svn1234-dbg)
and development (yade-svn1234-dev) packages in ../, which you can install by:

  sudo dpkg -i ../yade-svn1234*.deb



== Scons options ==
===================

Scons is the tool used to build and install yade. Always run it from the top
directory of yade.

|           |              |below. This parameter is passed to the            |
|           |              |preprocessor as PREFIX macro (expands to quoted   |
|           |              |string).                                          |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|           |              |Scons autodetects svn revision or release number, |
|version    |auto          |so it will be "svn1144" or "0.11.0", for example. |
|           |              |If this fails, it will be "unknown". It is used to|
|           |              |build `SUFFIX` (see `variant`).                   |

|           |              |fast code with debug symbols included. Defaults to|
|           |              |false.                                            |

|buildPrefix|..            |compilation. This ensures that the source tree    |
|           |              |remains clean and that different builds (like     |
|           |              |optimized and debugging) are strictly separated,  |
|           |              |like build-0.11.0 and build-0.11.0-debug          |

|           |              |want a lower number. Equivalent to make -j4       |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|           |              |C++ compiler you want to use. You can say         |
|CXX        |g++           |CXX="distcc g++" to have distributed build, if    |
|           |              |that is configured.                               |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|           |              |Additional paths for the c proprocessor           |
|CPPPATH    |empty         |(whitespace separated). Use it for locally-       |
|           |              |installed libraries, eg.: CPPPATH="/usr/local/    |
|           |              |include /home/fred/build/log4cxx/include"         |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|LIBPATH    |empty         |Additional paths for linker (whitespace           |
|           |              |separated).                                       |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|

To see all the options, along with their default and current values, say `scons -h`.
As an example, to compile yade I use following command

  scons jobs=10 pretty=0 debug=1 optimize=0 profile=0 CXX="distcc g++" \
        PREFIX=/home/janek/YADE useMiniWm3=0 CPPPATH=/usr/include/wm3

The last two options are related to the_wildmagic_3_library. All options are
stored inside scons.config file, so the next time you compile yade, you can
really just issue scons command, unless you want to change something.


== Automatic library detection ==
=================================

Scons will attempt detection of necessary libraries on your system at every
run. If it fails, you can look at the $buildDir/config.log (eg.: ../build-
0.11.0/config.log) file to see what went wrong. If you have some of the
dependencies (like lib3dviewer) installed locally in /usr/local, you will have
to use:

  scons CPPPATH=/usr/local/include/wm3 LIBPATH=/usr/local/lib

so that scons will find it.


== Installing the wildmagic 3 library on debian ==
==================================================

The wildmagic_3.11_library ( http://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html )
is used by Lattice Geometrical Model when it's available. It's only to have
dalaunay triangulation in 2D and 3D during specimen generation.
Add the following line at the end of your /etc/apt/sources.list:

  deb-src http://geo.hmg.inpg.fr/~smilauer/yade ./

Then donwload, compile and install wildmagic library:

  sudo apt-get update
  apt-get source wildmagic
  sudo apt-get build-dep wildmagic
  cd wildmagic-3p11/
  fakeroot debian/rules binary
  sudo dpkg -i ../wildmagic-dev*.deb

To tell scons that wildmagic is installed you need to add those parameters to
scons: useMiniWm3=0 CPPPATH=/usr/include/wm3.


== Backward compatibility options ==
====================================

If you have older software installed, you can use:

____________________________Compatibility_options____________________________
|parameter                     |description                                   |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|                              |Older versions of libglut do not have function|
|CXXFLAGS='-DNO_GLUTINIT'      |glutInit(), you should use this compilation   |
|                              |flag then.                                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|                              |If you are using older QGLViewer (version 2.0)|
|CXXFLAGS='-DQGLVIEWER20'      |you should use this flag, otherwise you will  |
|                              |get error about setFileName().                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|CXXFLAGS='-pthreadÂ -lpthread'|If you are compiling with gcc3.3 (an older    |
|                              |compiler).                                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|CXXFLAGS='-fPIC'              |When compiling on AMD64.                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|

You can connect several CXXFLAGS by spaces: CXXFLAGS='-DNO_GLUTINIT -
DQGLVIEWER20'


== Cleaning and uninstalling ==
===============================

To clean the compilation invoke from yade-0.11.1/:

  scons -c

You can remove the compilation directory of yade, usually located in upper
directory and starting with name build, like this one:

  rm -rf ../build-0.11.1

If yade was installed manually, the you can delete files from

  /usr/local/lib/yade/
  /usr/local/include/yade/
  /usr/local/bin/yade

or from (depending where yade was installed):

  /home/username/YADE/lib/
  /home/username/YADE/include/
  /home/username/YADE/bin/yade

If yade was installed from debian package, you can simply remove the package,
and that's all.


==  Install paths ==
====================

All files installed are versioned so that different versions and variants don't
clash with each other - you can have as many version as you want installed at
the same time. Supposing that we have variant=-dbg and version=svn1234 (note
that $SUFFIX=-$version$variant) and PREFIX=/usr/local, we have
