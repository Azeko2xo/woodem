from this directory level you can install whole yade at once.
It's a good solution when installing yade for the first time. When you
install something next time, it is better to install only from directories
that have changed their version numers - you will save on compilation time.

INSTALLING:

to compile and install whole yade execute following commands:

	make compile_install
	make clean		# to clean afterwards

    WARNING: command 'make compile_install' is compiling and installing,
    this is because compiling next packege requires the previous one to
    be already installed otherwise compilation will fail. (normally we
    should invoke 'make && make install', so here is an exception)

by default everything is installed in directory INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local,
if for example you want to install in /usr instead, you can do this:

	make compile_install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

NOTES:
 1. Both INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR should start with / and shouldn't have
    trailing slash.
 2. If compilation is interrupted (eg. due to some compilation error), and
    then resumed with different INSTALL_DIR or PREFIX_DIR, then all *.pro
    files (used by qmake) will be damaged (wrong INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR
    inside)

Or if you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make compile_install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

!!  WARNING: if you are compiling with gcc3.3, you need to pass additional
    argument:

        make compile_install CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread'
	
	
OTHER MAKE COMMANDS

	make uninstall          # to uninstall (you have to provide correct 
	                        #               INSTALL_DIR, and PREFIX_DIR ) 
	

DOCUMENTATION:

we plan to have documentation in doc/ directory of each library, but for now
nothing is there.
