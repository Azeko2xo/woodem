COMPILATION
===========

This version of yade relies uniquely on the scons build system. You can download if from http://www.scons.org, but chances are, that scons exists for your distribution (package scons, most likely). Its usage is very simple. Type "scons -h" to see available options for yade. Type "scons -H" to see options for scons proper. You need to set yade options only once, they will be remembered (in the scons.conf file). The ones you may need are:

 1. CPPPATH: to add some search paths for preprocessor
 2. CXX: to change compiler
 3. LIBPATH: extra directories for linker
 4. PREFIX: where to install: default is /usr/local
 5. POSTFIX: distinguishes different installations of yade; it will really be version-POSTFIX; if you don't specify anything, svn version (like r1088) will be used
 6. buildPrefix: where to create build directory; default is '..'

Scons will autodetect libraries as needed, if anything fails, see config.log.

After compilation and installation (which are really not separate), you will be able to run yade - look in $PREFIX/bin directory for the executable.

DEBIAN PACKAGE COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
===========================================

Make sure you have all packages needed for building:

	$ sudo apt-get install debhelper scons lib3dviewer-dev libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools python-dev freeglut3-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev wildmagic-dev liblog4cxx9-dev docbook-to-man

Note that lib3dviewer-dev and wildmagic-dev are not in official archives - see http://yade.berlios.de or http://beta.arcig.cz/~eudoxos/phd/index.cgi/YaDe/DebianSnapshotInstallHowto on how to get them.

Then go ahead:

	$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/yade/branches/scons-layout yade-xxx # (change xxx to revision number as appropriate)
	$ cd yade-0.0.svn1112
	$ scripts/svn-debian-prep # creates files SVNVERSION, _SVNVERSION and appropriate debian/control
	$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot-tcp # compiles and creates source and binary packages in ../
	$ sudo dpkg -i ../yade-svn*-0.1.1-1_i386.dpkg
    
There are some limitations at this moment: version hardcoded in the control file, plain fakeroot will not work with scons (most likely because not all environment variables are propagated by scons - to be investigated).

RUNNING
=======

Yade must be able to find its plugins if it is to function correctly - that should happen automatically. ~/.yade-??? will hold file named preferences.xml, which will be created on the first run.

For the rest, head over to http://yade.berlios.de and read documentation.
