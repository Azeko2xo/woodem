This example tests performance of PersistentSAPCollider and SpatialQuickSortCollider
and was basis for http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace .

To run the test, say:

 yade-trunk-multi perf.table perf.py

and wait. If you feel brave enough, uncomment lines with many spheres in perf.table. 
They take very long time (128k spheres with SAP collider over 3 hours)


1. File with nSpheres spheres (loose packing) is generated first, it if doesn't exist yet.
   This can take a few minutes, but is done only the first time for the particular sphere
	number.
2. First iteration on the scene (TriaxialTest and the selected collider) with timings is
   done and timing.stats() printed (appears in the log file).
3. Another 100 iterations are measured with siming.stats(), after which the test exits.

To get the results, grep the resulting log files, named like perf.64k.log (64k spheres with
PersistentSAPCollider), perf.32k.q.log (32k spheres, SpatialQuickSortCollider) etc.
