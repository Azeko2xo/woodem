This example tests performance of PersistentSAPCollider and SpatialQuickSortCollider
and was basis for http://yade.wikia.com/wiki/Colliders_performace .

To run the test, say:

 yade-trunk-multi perf.table perf.py

It will take time to finish. To get graphs from the generated log files, say

 python mkGraph.py *.log

To see other results, log files are named like perf.64k.log (64k spheres with
PersistentSAPCollider), perf.32k.q.log (32k spheres, SpatialQuickSortCollider) etc.

1. File with nSpheres spheres (loose packing) is generated first, it if doesn't exist yet.
   This can take a few minutes, but is done only the first time for the particular sphere
	number.
2. First iteration on the scene (TriaxialTest and the selected collider) with timings is
   done and timing.stats() printed (appears in the log file).
3. Another 100 iterations are measured with siming.stats(), after which the test exits.
