# shows the (unexplained) influence of geometry implementation on macroscopic

# using different dtSafety values -- the difference is therefore not that the
# incremental implementation is more sensitive to Δt.

# Computations with ScGeom as (variably) faster regarding computational t/step,
# but are less efficient in multi-threading
# (that might be due to the implementation of Law2_ScGeom_CpmPhys_Cpm, though)
