from this directory level you can install all libraries at once.
It's a good solution when installing yade for the first time. When you
install something next time, it is better to install only from directories
that have changed their version numers - you will save on compilation time.

INSTALLING:

to compile and install all yade libraries execute following commands:

	make
	make install
	make clean		# to clean afterwards

by default everything is installed in directory /usr/local, if for example
you want to install in /usr instead, you can do this:

	make install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

Or if you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'



DOCUMENTATION:

we plan to have documentation in doc/ directory of each library, but for now
nothing is there.
