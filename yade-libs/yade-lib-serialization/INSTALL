INSTALLING:

to compile and install this library execute following commands:

	make
	make install

by default everything is installed in directory /usr/local, if for example
you want to install in /usr instead, you can do this:

	make install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

Or if you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'


    WARNING: if you are compiling with gcc3.3, you need to pass additional argument:
	
	make CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread'


OTHER MAKE COMMANDS

	make clean		# to clean afterwards
	make uninstall          # to uninstall (you have to provide
	                        # correct INSTALL_DIR, and PREFIX_DIR )
