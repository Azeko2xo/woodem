INSTALLING:

to compile and install this library execute following commands:

	make
	make install
	make clean		# to clean afterwards

by default everything is installed in directory INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local,
if for example you want to install somewhere else instead, you can do this:

As a root user:

	make install INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

As a user without root privileages:

        mkdir ~/YADE
        make install INSTALL_DIR='/YADE' PREFIX_DIR='/home/joeuser'

If you are a package maintaner, you may want to install everything in
different directory tree:

	make install PREFIX_DIR='/tmp/foo' INSTALL_DIR='/usr'

NOTES:
 1. Both INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR should start with / and shouldn't have
    trailing slash.

 2. If compilation is interrupted (eg. due to some compilation error), and
    then resumed with *different* INSTALL_DIR or PREFIX_DIR, then all *.pro
    files (used by qmake) will be damaged (wrong INSTALL_DIR and PREFIX_DIR
    inside)

 3. If you are compiling with gcc3.3, you need to pass additional argument:

	make CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread'

 4. flag CXXFLAGS can be used to set some compilation options, like:

        CXXFLAGS='-O3'                     : optimize code for speed
	CXXFLAGS='-pthread -lpthread -O3'  : gcc3.3, and optimize for speed
	CXXFLAGS='-g'                      : debugging symbols
	CXXFLAGS='-DDOUBLE_PRECISION -O3'  : for calculation use double precision
	                                     instead of float and optimize for speed


OTHER MAKE COMMANDS

	make clean		# to clean afterwards
	make uninstall          # to uninstall (you have to provide
	                        # correct INSTALL_DIR, and PREFIX_DIR )
