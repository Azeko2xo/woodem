/*! Periodic collider notes.

Use
===
* scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
* In the future, triaxial compression working by growing/shrinking the cell should be implemented.

Architecture
============
Values from bounding boxes are added information about period in which they are.
Their container (VecBounds) holds position of where the space wraps.
The sorting algorithm is changed in such way that periods are changed when body crosses cell boundary.

Interaction::cellDist holds information about relative cell coordinates of the 2nd body
relative to the 1st one. Dispatchers (IGeomDispatcher and InteractionLoop)
use this information to pass modified position of the 2nd body to IGeomFunctors.
Since properly behaving IGeomFunctor's and LawFunctor's do not take positions
directly from Body::state, the interaction is computed with the periodic positions.

Positions of bodies (in the sense of Body::state) and their natural bboxes are not wrapped
to the periodic cell, they can be anywhere (but not "too far" in the sense of int overflow).

Since Interaction::cellDists holds cell coordinates, it is possible to change the cell boundaries
at runtime. This should make it easy to implement some stress control on the top.

Clumps do not interfere with periodicity in any way.

Rendering
---------
OpenGLRenderer renders Shape at all periodic positions that touch the
periodic cell (i.e. Bounds crosses its boundary).

It seems to affect body selection somehow, but that is perhaps not related at all.

Periodicity control
===================
c++:
	Scene::isPeriodic, Scene::cellSize
python:
	O.periodicCell=((0,0,0),(10,10,10)  # activates periodic boundary
	O.periodicCell=() # deactivates periodic boundary

Requirements
============
* No body can have Aabb larger than about .499*cellSize. Exception is thrown if that is false.
* Constitutive law must not get body positions from Body::state directly.
	If it does, it uses Interaction::cellDist to compute periodic position.
	Dem3Dof family of Ig2 functors and Law2_* engines are known to behave well.
* No body can get further away than MAXINT periods. It will do horrible things if there is overflow. Not checked at the moment.
* Body cannot move over distance > cellSize in one step. Since body size is limited as well, that would mean simulation explosion.
	Exception is thrown if the movement is upwards. If downwards, it is not handled at all.

Possible performance improvements & bugs
========================================

* PeriodicInsertionSortCollider::{cellWrap,cellWrapRel} OpenGLRenderer::{wrapCell,wrapCellPt} Shop::PeriodicWrap
	are all very similar functions. They should be put into separate header and included from all those places.

		Collider with O(n log(n)) complexity, using :obj:`Aabb` for bounds.\
		\n\n\
		At the initial step, Bodies' bounds (along sortAxis) are first std::sort'ed along one axis (sortAxis), then collided. The initial sort has :math:`O(n^2)` complexity, see `Colliders' performance <https://yade-dem.org/index.php/Colliders_performace>`_ for some information (There are scripts in examples/collider-perf for measurements). \
		\n\n \
		Insertion sort is used for sorting the bound list that is already pre-sorted from last iteration, where each inversion	calls checkOverlap which then handles either overlap (by creating interaction if necessary) or its absence (by deleting interaction if it is only potential).	\
		\n\n \
		Bodies without bounding volume (such as clumps) are handled gracefully and never collide. Deleted bodies are handled gracefully as well.\
		\n\n \
		This collider handles periodic boundary conditions. There are some limitations, notably:\
		\n\n \
			#. No body can have Aabb larger than cell's half size in that respective dimension. You get exception it it does and gets in interaction.\
			\n\n \
			#. No body can travel more than cell's distance in one step; this would mean that the simulation is numerically exploding, and it is only detected in some cases.\
		\n\n \
		**Stride** can be used to avoid running collider at every step by enlarging the particle's bounds, tracking their velocities and only re-run if they might have gone out of that bounds (see `Verlet list <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_list>`_ for brief description and background) . This requires cooperation from :obj:`Leapfrog` as well as :obj:`BoundDispatcher`, which will be found among engines automatically (exception is thrown if they are not found).\
		\n\n \
		If you wish to use strides, set ``verletDist`` (length by which bounds will be enlarged in all directions) to some value, e.g. 0.05 × typical particle radius. This parameter expresses the tradeoff between many potential interactions (running collider rarely, but with longer exact interaction resolution phase) and few potential interactions (running collider more frequently, but with less exact resolutions of interactions); it depends mainly on packing density and particle radius distribution.\
		\n\n \
		If you additionally set ``nBins`` to >=1, not all particles will have their bound enlarged by ``verletDist``; instead, they will be put to bins (in the statistical sense) based on magnitude of their velocity; ``verletDist`` will only be used for particles in the fastest bin, whereas only proportionally smaller length will be used for slower particles; The coefficient between bin's velocities is given by ``binCoeff``.\
