This law adds adhesion and moments to :yref:`Law2_ScGeom_FrictPhys_CundallStrack`.\n\nThe normal force is (with the convention of positive tensile forces) $F_n=min(k_n*u_n, a_n)$, with $a_n$ the normal adhesion. The shear force is $F_s=k_s*u_s$, the plasticity condition defines the maximum value of the shear force, by default $F_s^{max}=F_n*tan(\\phi)+a_s$, with $\\phi$ the friction angle and $a_n$ the shear adhesion. If :yref:`CohFrictPhys::cohesionDisableFriction` is True, friction is ignored as long as adhesion is active, and the maximum shear force is only $F_s^{max}=a_s$.\n\nIf the maximum tensile or maximum shear force is reached and :yref:`CohFrictPhys::fragile` =True (default), the cohesive link is broken, and $a_n, a_s$ are set back to zero. If a tensile force is present, the contact is lost, else the shear strength is $F_s^{max}=F_n*tan(\\phi)$. If :yref:`CohFrictPhys::fragile` =False (in course of implementation), the behaviour is perfectly plastic, and the shear strength is kept constant.\n\nIf :yref:`Law2_ScGeom6D_CohFrictPhys_CohesionMoment::momentRotationLaw` =True, bending and twisting moments are computed using a linear law with moduli respectively $k_t$ and $k_r$ (the two values are the same currently), so that the moments are : $M_b=k_b*\\Theta_b$ and $M_t=k_t*\\Theta_t$, with $\\Theta_{b,t}$ the relative rotations between interacting bodies. There is no maximum value of moments in the current implementation, though they could be added in the future.\n\nCreep at contact is implemented in this law, as defined in [Hassan2010]_. If activated, there is a viscous behaviour of the shear and twisting components, and the evolution of the elastic parts of shear displacement and relative twist is given by $du_{s,e}/dt=-F_s/\\nu_s$ and $d\\Theta_{t,e}/dt=-M_t/\\nu_t$.\n\n.. note::\n  Periodicity is not handled yet in this law.",
