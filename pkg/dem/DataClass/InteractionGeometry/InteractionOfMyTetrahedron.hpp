/*! 
 * \brief This class stores an information about current collision/interaction of two bodies
 * that can talk with the InteractingMyTetrahedron.
 *
 * "can talk" means that an EngineUnit is written for this pair of bodies, in this example I have written:
 *
 * InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingBox4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 * InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingMyTetrahedron4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
 * Following table shows currently plssible interactions:
 *
 *                           |  InteractingMyTetrahedron   InteractingBox   InteractingSphere
 * --------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
 * InteractingMyTetrahedron  |             +                     +                 -
 * InteractingBox            |             +                     -                 -
 * InteractingSphere         |             -                     -                 -
 *
 * 
 * If you will write class
 *
 * InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingSphere4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
 * Then this interaction will become possible too. Just remember to register it
 * inside TetrahedronsTest in function createActors. And that's - your
 * tetrahedrons will be able to collide with spheres :)
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Information about current interaction is here very simplified, so that I can
 * make this example quickly.
 *
 * In this example I am assuming that in general this interaction is
 * represented as a collision of two four-sphered bodies. Therefore I will
 * store here penetration depth for each of the spheres. Since in each body
 * four spheres are assumed to exist then I will have a 4x4 matrix of
 * penetration depths, a 4x4 matrix of normal directions of each penetration,
 * and a 4x4 matrix of contact points.
 *
 * So here you can see that the example interaction with InteractingBox will be
 * in fact emulating that the box contains four spheres. You can check that in
 * InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingBox4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
