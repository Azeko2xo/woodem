It includes possibility of cohesion, moment transfer and inelastic compression behaviour (to reproduce the normal inelasticity observed for rock joints, for the latter).\n\n The moment transfer relation corresponds to the adaptation of the work of Plassiard & Belheine (see in [DeghmReport2006]_ for example), which was realized by J. Kozicki, and is now coded in :yref:`ScGeom6D`.\n\n As others :yref:`LawFunctor`, it uses pre-computed data of the interactions (rigidities, friction angles -with their tan()-, orientations of the interactions); this work is done here in :yref:`Ip2_2xNormalInelasticMat_NormalInelasticityPhys`.\n\n To use this you should also use :yref:`NormalInelasticMat` as material type of the bodies.\n\n The effects of this law are illustrated in scripts/normalInelasticityTest.py",
