=== HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF CPM ===

Concrete Particle Model (ConcretePM, Cpm) is a set of classes for modelling
mechanical behavior of concrete. Several classes are needed for Cpm.

1. CpmMat (Cpm material) deriving from BodyMacroParameters, which additionally has
   some information about damage on the body, cummulative plastic strain etc.

2.	Ip2_CpmMat_CpmMat_CpmPhys is 2-ary functor for creating CpmPhys from CpmMat's of
	2 bodies that collide. Some parameters of the CpmPhys created are computed from
	CpmMat's, others are passed as parameters of the functor.

3. CpmPhys (Cpm (interaction)Physics) holds various parameters as well as internal
   variables of the contact that can change as result of plasticity, damage, viscosity.

4. Law2_Dem3Dof_CpmPhys_Cpm is constitutive law that takes geometry of the interaction
	(Dem3Dof, which can be either Dem3Dof_SphereSphere or Dem3Dof_FacetSphere) and
	CpmPhys, computing forces on both bodies and updating contact variables.

	The model itself is defined in the macro CPM_MATERIAL_MODEL, but due to 
	commercial reasons, those about 30 lines of code cannot be disclosed now and the macro
	is defined in an external file. The model will be, however, described in enough detail
	in my thesis (once it is written), along
	with calibration procedures; it features damage, plasticity and viscosity
	and is quite tunable (rigidity, poisson's	ratio, compressive/tensile strength
	ratio, fracture energy, behavior under confinement, rate-dependence).

There are other classes, which are not strictly necessary:

 * CpmGlobalCharacteristics computes a few information about individual bodies based on
   interactions they are involved in. It is probably quite useless now since volumetricStrain
	is not used in the constitutive law anymore.

 * GLDrawCpmPhys draws interaction physics (color for damage and a few other); rarely used, though.

 * CpmStateUpdater changes bodies' colors depending on average damage of their interactions
   and number of interactions that were already fully broken and have disappeared. This engine
	contains its own loop (2 loops, more precisely) over all bodies and is run periodically
	to update colors.
