Discrete non-cumulative PSDs are handled specially: discrete distributions return skypline plot with peaks represented as plateaus of the relative width 1/*num*; continuous distributions return ideal histogram computed for relative bin with 1/*num*; thus returned histogram will match non-cummulative histogram returned by `ParticleGenerator.psd(cumulative=False)`, provided *num* is the same in both cases.")
