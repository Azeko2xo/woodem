/**
=== OVERVIEW OF WirePM ===

A particle model to simulate single wires and rockfall meshes (see Bertrad et al. 2005, Bertrad et al. 2008).

Features of the interaction law:

1. The law is designed for particles which do not touch. A link will be created by defining an interaction radius and running the threshold iteration.

2. The contact law is for tension only. Compressive forces never exist between the particles. However, elastic unloading is considered.

3. The force displacement curve which defines the interaction forces is piecewise linear and defined by the stress-strain curve of the wire material. Any piecewise linear curve can be used. 

Remarks:
- The contact law is new and still needs some testing :-)
