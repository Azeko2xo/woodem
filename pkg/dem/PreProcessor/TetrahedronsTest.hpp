/*! 
 * \brief This class derived from FileGenerator is what can be called an 
 *
 *    int main(argc, argv**);
 *
 *  of the simulation. This is where the execution flow control, and the data
 *  are put together to make a sensible, working simulation.
 *
 *
 * So the main loop, Body->engines:
 *
 *  - with class InteractingMyTetrahedron2AABB registered in TetrahedronsTest inside an MetaEngine called
 *     boundigVolumeDispatcher yade will automatically create AABB from InteractingMyTetrahedron
 *
 *  - with AABB available, the PersistentSAPCollider will be able to detect that two bodies are interacting
 *
 *  - if interaction is detected, an appropriate EngineUnit will be called, in
 *    this small example I have just two of them:
 *
 *        InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingBox4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *        InteractingMyTetrahedron2InteractingMyTetrahedron4InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
 *    depending on between what kind of body there is an interaction.
 *
 *    They will create for us a class InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
 *  - For any interaction we need to calculate the physics of interaction,
 *    class NormalInteraction. It is created by ElasticBodySimpleRelationship
 *    inside MetaEngine interactionPhysicsDispatcher
 *
 *  - with all that info available it is possibel to calculate PhysicalActions: a Force and a Momentum,
 *    class MyTetrahedronLaw is doing the job
 *
 *  - then we can apply gravityCondition (an additional force directed downwards)
 *
 *  - apply damping on Force and Momentum (you can remove that part, because a
 *    realistic scientific calculation should not need to use damping ;)
 *    this is done by actionDampingDispatcher
 *
 *  - then we can apply those PhysicalActions on the Body, thus calculate new
 *    body's acceleration and angularAcceleration using NewtonsLaw. class applyActionDispatcher does just that
 *
 *  - and finally the new body's position is integrated using leapfrog integration
 *
 *
 *
 * There is also a secondary loop Body->initializers, which is called only for the first time, before the simulation.
 * It is used to build BoundingVolume of bodies and InteractingMyTetrahedron from the GeometricalModel (Tetrahedron)\
 *
 *
 * additionally physicalActionInitializer and PhysicalActionContainerReseter
 * are used on each iteration to reset calculated forces and momentums back to
 * zero (otherwise they could accumulate from one iteration to another, a thing
 * we don't want to happen :)
