/*! 
 * \brief This class exists to create an InteractingMyTetrahedron from Tetrahedron
 *
 * Vaclav: here you will create a representation of tetrahedron that you want to use
 * for calculating interactions. The simplest example is to use four spheres.
 *  - each sphere's center is a midpoint between the tetrahedron's node and tetrahedron's center
 *  - each sphere's radius is equal to the distance from this midpoint to the tetrahedron's center (and node)
 *
 * You may want to use any other representation. Even a tetrahedron, but then
 * be catious when you calculate forces when collision is with the edge. Maybe
 * you will have to compute not penetrationDepth of the collision, but the
 * overlapping volume. Becasue the colliding force will be linear proportional
 * not to the penetrationDepth but to the amount of volume?
 *
 * it's your choince :)
