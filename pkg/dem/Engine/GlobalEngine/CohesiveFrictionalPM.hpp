=== OVERVIEW OF CohesiveFrictionalPM ===

CohesiveFrictional Particle Model (CohesiveFrictionalPM, CFpm) is a set of classes for modelling mechanical behavior of cohesive frictional material. It is a quite general contact model starting from the basic frictional model with the possible addition of a moment between particles, a tensile strength and a cohesion.

Features of the interaction law:

1.  If useAlphaBeta=False, Kn, Ks are calculated from the harmonic average of the "macro" material parameters young (E) and poisson (V) as defined in SimpleElasticRelationships.cpp and Kr=0.

2.  If useAlphaBeta=True, users have to input Alpha=Ks/Kn, Beta=Kr/(Ks*meanRadius^2), eta=MtPlastic/(meanRadius*Fn) as defined in Plassiard et al. (Granular Matter, 2009) A spherical discrete element model.

3.  Users can input a tensile strength ( FnMax = tensileStrength*pi*Rmin^2 ) and a cohesion ( FsMax = cohesion*pi*Rmin^2 )

  Remark: - This contact law works well in the case of sphere/sphere and sphere/box interaction as it uses ScGeom to compute the interaction geometry (suitable for the triaxialTest) 
	  - It has not been tested for sphere/facet or sphere/wall interactions and could be updated to be used by DemXDofGeom
