				 "To apply a constant normal stress shear for a parallelogram box (simple shear)\n\nThis engine, used in simulations issued from :yref:`SimpleShear` Preprocessor, allows to translate horizontally the upper plate while the lateral ones rotate so that they always keep contact with the lower and upper walls.\n\nIn fact the upper plate can move not only horizontally but also vertically, so that the normal stress acting on it remains constant (this constant value is not choosen by the user but is the one that exists at the beginning of the simulation)\n\nThe right vertical displacements which will be allowed are computed from the rigidity Kn of the sample over the wall (so to cancel a deltaSigma, a normal dplt deltaSigma*S/(Kn) is set)\n\nThe movement is moreover controlled by the user via a *shearSpeed* which will be the speed of the upper wall, and by a maximum value of horizontal displacement *gammalim*, after which the shear stops.\n\n.. note::\n\tNot only the positions of walls are updated but also their speeds, which is all but useless considering the fact that in the contact laws these velocities of bodies are used to compute values of tangential relative displacements.\n\n.. warning::\n\tBecause of this last point, if you want to use later saves of simulations executed with this Engine, but without that stopMovement was executed, your boxes will keep their speeds => you will have to cancel them 'by hand' in the .xml.\n",
