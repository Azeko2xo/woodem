		"Disturbs a simple shear sample in a given displacement direction\n\nThis engine allows to apply, on a simple shear sample, a loading controlled by du/dgamma = cste, which is equivalent to du + cste' * dgamma = 0 (proportionnal path loadings).\nTo do so, the upper plate of the simple shear box is moved in a given direction (corresponding to a given du/dgamma), whereas lateral plates are moved so that the box remains closed.\nThis engine can easily be used to perform directionnal probes, with a python script launching successivly the same .xml which contains this engine, after having modified the direction of loading (see *theta* attribute). That's why this Engine contains a *saveData* procedure which can save data on the state of the sample at the end of the loading (in case of successive loadings - for successive directions - through a python script, each line would correspond to one direction of loading).",
