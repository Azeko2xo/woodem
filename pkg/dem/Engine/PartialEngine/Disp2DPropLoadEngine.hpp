/*! \brief To disturb a sample in a given direction (initial aim : directionnal research for dÂ²w)

The aim of this engine is to perform what is called a "directionnal research" over a sample. That is to say : considering a sample in a given state, disturbing it in all the directions (directions in the stresses plane for example)

In fact this Engine disturbs in only one direction
The control will be done in displacements in fact since it is much more easier
Nota : not only the positions of walls are updated but also their speeds, which is all but useless considering the fact that in the contact laws these velocities of bodies are used to compute values of tangential relative displacements

!!WARNING!! : But, because of this last point, if you want to use later saves of simulations executed with this Engine, but without that stopMovement was executed, your boxes will keep their speeds => you will have to cancel them "by hand" in the .xml
