/** \brief Class for controlling in stress or in strain with respect to each spatial direction a cubical assembly of particles.
 *
 * The engine perform a triaxial compression with a control in direction "i" in stress "if (stressControl_i)" else in strain.
 * For a stress control the imposed stress is specified by "sigma_i" with a "max_veli" depending on "strainRatei". To obtain the same strain rate in stress control than in strain control you need to set "wallDamping = 0.8".
 * For a strain control the imposed strain is specified by "strainRatei".
 * With this engine you can perform internal compaction by growing the size of particles by using TriaxialStressController::controlInternalStress . For that, just switch on 'internalCompaction=1' and fix sigma_iso=value of mean pressure that you want at the end of the internal compaction.
