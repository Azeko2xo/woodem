/*! Axial displacing two groups of bodies in the opposite direction with given strain rate.
 *
 * Takes two groups of body IDs (in posIds and negIds) and displaces them at each timestep in the direction given by axis∈{0,1,2} (for axes x,y,z respectively). These bodies automatically have Body::isDynamic==false.
