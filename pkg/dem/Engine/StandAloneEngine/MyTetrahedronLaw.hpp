/*! 
 * \brief This class exists for the sole purpose of calculating force and
 * momentum acting on two interacting tetrahedrons, where interaction data is
 * stored inside InteractionOfMyTetrahedron
 *
 * Those example calculations are very simple:
 *
 *  - the force is just a sum of all normals multiplied by penetrationDepth
 *    multiplied by stiffness (Hooke's Law ;)
 *
 *  - the momentum is just a force multiplied by the arm's length of the acting
 *    force. Arm's length is a projection of distance of contact point to the
 *    tetrahedron's center on direction perpendicular to the acting force.
