/* Collider that should run in O(n log(n)) time, but faster than historical PersistentSAPCollider.

	At the initial step, Bodies' bounds (along sortAxis) are first std::sort'ed along one axis (sortAxis), then collided.

	Insertion sort is used for sorting the bound list that is already pre-sorted from last iteration, where each inversion
	calls checkOverlap which then handles either overlap (by creating interaction if necessary) or its absence (by deleting
	interaction if it is only potential).

	Bodies without bounding volume are handled gracefully and never collide.

/*! Periodic collider notes.

Use
===
* scripts/test/periodic-simple.py
* In the future, triaxial compression working by growing/shrinking the cell should be implemented.

Architecture
============
Values from bounding boxes are added information about period in which they are.
Their container (VecBounds) holds position of where the space wraps.
The sorting algorithm is changed in such way that periods are changed when body crosses cell boundary.

Interaction::cellDist holds information about relative cell coordinates of the 2nd body
relative to the 1st one. Dispatchers (InteractionGeometryDispatcher and InteractionDispatchers)
use this information to pass modified position of the 2nd body to InteractionGeometryFunctors.
Since properly behaving InteractionGeometryFunctor's and LawFunctor's do not take positions
directly from Body::state, the interaction is computed with the periodic positions.

Positions of bodies (in the sense of Body::state) and their natural bboxes are not wrapped
to the periodic cell, they can be anywhere (but not "too far" in the sense of int overflow).

Since Interaction::cellDists holds cell coordinates, it is possible to change the cell boundaries
at runtime. This should make it easy to implement some stress control on the top.

Clumps do not interfere with periodicity in any way.

Rendering
---------
OpenGLRenderingEngine renders Shape at all periodic positions that touch the
periodic cell (i.e. Bounds crosses its boundary).

It seems to affect body selection somehow, but that is perhaps not related at all.

Periodicity control
===================
c++:
	Scene::isPeriodic, Scene::cellSize
python:
	O.periodicCell=((0,0,0),(10,10,10)  # activates periodic boundary
	O.periodicCell=() # deactivates periodic boundary

Requirements
============
* No body can have Aabb larger than about .499*cellSize. Exception is thrown if that is false.
* Constitutive law must not get body positions from Body::state directly.
	If it does, it uses Interaction::cellDist to compute periodic position.
	Dem3Dof family of Ig2 functors and Law2_* engines are known to behave well.
* No body can get further away than MAXINT periods. It will do horrible things if there is overflow. Not checked at the moment.
* Body cannot move over distance > cellSize in one step. Since body size is limited as well, that would mean simulation explosion.
	Exception is thrown if the movement is upwards. If downwards, it is not handled at all.

Possible performance improvements & bugs
========================================

* PeriodicInsertionSortCollider::{cellWrap,cellWrapRel} OpenGLRenderingEngine::{wrapCell,wrapCellPt} Shop::PeriodicWrap
	are all very similar functions. They should be put into separate header and included from all those places.
