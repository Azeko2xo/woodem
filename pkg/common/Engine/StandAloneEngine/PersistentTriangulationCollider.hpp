/*! \brief Collision detection engine based on regular triangulation.
 
 	This engine is using CGAL library (see http://www.cgal.org/)
 	It is still experimental.
 	Uncoment lines in sconscript file to compile it and just change the name of the collider in an existing xml and it will (should) work.
 	Also needed : uncommenting lines in core/Interaction.cpp and core/Interaction.hpp (see NOTE:TriangulationCollider
