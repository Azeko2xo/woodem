# This module is imported at startup. It is meant to update
# docstrings of wrapper classes, which are not practical to document
# in the c++ source itself, due to the necessity of writing
# \n for newlines and having everything as "string".
#
# PLEASE:
#
# 1. provide at least brief description of the class
#    in the c++ code (for those who read it) and 
#
# 2. Add something like
#
#    "Full documentation of this class is in py/_extraDocs.py."
#
#    to the c++ documentation.

import wrapper

# Update docstring of your class/function like this:
#
#	wrapper.YourClass.__doc__="""
#		This class is documented from _extraDocs.py. Yay!
#
#		.. note::
#			The c++ documentation will be overwritten by this string.
