pygts-0.3.1:
	homepage: http://pygts.sourceforge.net/
	documentation: http://pygts.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pygts/doc/gts.html
	license: GNU GPL v2
	note: the local version is only the 'gts' directory of the source archive (doc, examples, test ommited). Distutils are not used for building either.
	patch: pygts.py has the following lines added at the beginning:

		# added by eudoxos 29.1.2011, fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/woo/+bug/668329
		## force decimal separator to be always . (decimal point), not , (decimal comma) -- unless LC_ALL is set, then we are stuck
		## this was reason for bogus gts imports
		## adding to woo main does not solve the problem for some reason
		import locale
		locale.setlocale(locale.LC_NUMERIC,'C')

	The entire source was c++-ified because of the inability of distutils to give different compiler flags to different files; the -std=c++11 flags was necessary for c++ sources but causing error for plain C sources.
