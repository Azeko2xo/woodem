"""A package for constructing and manipulating triangulated surfaces.

PyGTS is a python binding for the GNU Triangulated Surface (GTS) 
Library, which may be used to build, manipulate, and perform
computations on triangulated surfaces.

The following geometric primitives are provided:

*  Point - a point in 3D space
*  Vertex - a Point in 3D space that may be used to define a Segment
*  Segment - a line defined by two Vertex end-points
*  Edge - a Segment that may be used to define the edge of a Triangle
*  Triangle - a triangle defined by three Edges
*  Face - a Triangle that may be used to define a face on a Surface
*  Surface - a surface composed of Faces

A tetrahedron is assembled from these primitives as follows.  First,
create Vertices for each of the tetrahedron's points::

    import gts

    v1 = gts.Vertex(1,1,1)
    v2 = gts.Vertex(-1,-1,1)
    v3 = gts.Vertex(-1,1,-1)
    v4 = gts.Vertex(1,-1,-1)

Next, connect the four vertices to create six unique Edges::

    e1 = gts.Edge(v1,v2)
    e2 = gts.Edge(v2,v3)
    e3 = gts.Edge(v3,v1)
    e4 = gts.Edge(v1,v4)
    e5 = gts.Edge(v4,v2)
    e6 = gts.Edge(v4,v3)

The four triangular faces are composed using three edges each::

    f1 = gts.Face(e1,e2,e3)
    f2 = gts.Face(e1,e4,e5)
    f3 = gts.Face(e2,e5,e6)
    f4 = gts.Face(e3,e4,e6)

Finally, the surface is assembled from the faces::

    s = gts.Surface()
    for face in [f1,f2,f3,f4]:
        s.add(face)

Some care must be taken in the orientation of the faces.  In the above
example, the surface normals are pointing inward, and so the surface
technically defines a void, rather than a solid.  To create a 
tetrahedron with surface normals pointing outward, use the following
instead::

    f1.revert()
    s = Surface()
    for face in [f1,f2,f3,f4]:
        if not face.is_compatible(s):
            face.revert()
        s.add(face)

Once the Surface is constructed, there are many different operations that
can be performed.  For example, the volume can be calculated using::

    s.volume()

The difference between two Surfaces s1 and s2 is given by::

    s3 = s2.difference(s1)

Etc.

It is also possible to read in GTS data files and plot surfaces to
the screen.  See the example programs packaged with PyGTS for
more information.
