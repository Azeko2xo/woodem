This thin wrapper created using py++ wraps Vector2, Vector3, Matrix3 and Quaternion classes of Wm3
(with real numbers, i.e. Vector2r, Vector3r, Quaternionr, Matrix3r). The wrapper generator is pyplusplus,
svn revision 1755 of https://pygccxml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pygccxml/pyplusplus_dev

* Matrix2 is not wrapped (although it could be) as it is not used much in yade
  (use numpy.Matrix if you need them in pure python code).
* X(), Y(), Z(), W() methods are not supported, use the [] indexing to acces/update elements.
* Methods taking or returning unwrapped types (like Matrix2) are not
  wrapped either.
* This wrapper only works for typeof(Real)==typeof(double)
* The miniWm3Wrap-generate.py does a search&replace (perl) on the generate miniWm3Wrap.cpp
  to get rid of absolute include path(s). It is ugly, but works.

The following files are generated by py++, but included so that you don't have to install py++:
__call_policies.pypp.hpp, __convenience.pypp.hpp, miniWm3Wrap.cpp
